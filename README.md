## Blacklisting Clothes and / or Limiting them to Jobs / Gangs / ACEs

You can now blacklist different clothes by adding them in a specific format to `blacklist.json`. The default file contains all the component names that you can choose to blacklist. For example if you want to blacklist following items:

```
Jackets: 10, 12, 13, 18 (All Textures)
Jackets: 11 (Texture: 1, 2, 3)
Masks: 10, 11, 12, 13 (All Textures)
Masks: 14 (Texture: 5, 7, 10, 12, 13)
Jackets: 25, 30, 35 (Accessible only to "police" job)
Hats: 41, 42, 45 (Accessible only to "ballas" gang)
Scarfs & Chains: 5, 6, 7 (Accessible only to "vip" ACE)
```

Here is how the JSON file would look like, for such configuration:

```json
{
  "male": {
    "components": {
      "masks": [
        {
          "drawables": [10, 11, 12, 13]
        },
        {
          "drawables": [14],
          "textures": [5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13]
        }
      ],
      "upperBody": [],
      "lowerBody": [],
      "bags": [],
      "shoes": [],
      "scarfAndChains": [
        {
          "drawables": [5, 6, 7],
          "aces": ["vip"]
        }
      ],
      "shirts": [],
      "bodyArmor": [],
      "decals": [],
      "jackets": [
        {
          "drawables":  [11],
          "textures": [1, 2, 3]
        },
        {
          "drawables": [10, 12, 13, 18]
        },
        {
          "drawables": [25, 30, 35],
          "jobs": ["police"]
        }
      ]
    },
    "props": {
      "hats": [
        {
          "drawables": [41, 42, 45],
          "gangs": ["ballas"]
        }
      ],
      "glasses": [],
      "ear": [],
      "watches": [],
      "bracelets": []
    }
  },
  "female": {
    "components": {
      "masks": [],
      "upperBody": [],
      "lowerBody": [],
      "bags": [],
      "shoes": [],
      "scarfAndChains": [],
      "shirts": [],
      "bodyArmor": [],
      "decals": [],
      "jackets": []
    },
    "props": {
      "hats": [],
      "glasses": [],
      "ear": [],
      "watches": [],
      "bracelets": []
    }
  }
}
```

You can separately blacklist male and female clothes. Just put them under the right section in the json and you should be good to go.

## Limiting Ped Models to Jobs / Gangs / ACEs

You can now limit different ped models by adding them in a specific format to `peds.json`. The default file contains all the ped models without any blacklisting. For example if you want to limit following peds:

```
a_f_m_beach_01, a_f_m_bevhills_01, a_f_m_bevhills_02 => "police" job
a_f_m_bodybuild_01 => "vagos" gang
a_f_m_downtown_01 => "admin" ace
a_f_m_skidrow_01 => "police" job, "ballas" gang
```

To do this, you first need to remove all these peds from the `peds` list which doesn't have any filters / limits defined (The default one provided in `peds.json`).

Here is how the JSON file will look like, for such configuration (**Note:** The `...` should be the list of all peds that you want to be accessible to everyone):

```json
{
  "pedConfig": [
    {
      "peds": [...]
    },
    {
      "peds": ["a_f_m_beach_01", "a_f_m_bevhills_01", "a_f_m_bevhills_02"],
      "jobs": ["police"],
    },
    {
      "peds": ["a_f_m_bodybuild_01"],
      "gangs": ["vagos"],
    },
    {
      "peds": ["a_f_m_downtown_01"],
      "aces": ["admin"],
    },
    {
      "peds": ["a_f_m_skidrow_01"],
      "jobs": ["police"],
      "gangs": ["ballas"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Theme configuration

fivem-appearance comes with 2 themes, `default` and `qb-core` and `qb-core` is set as the default one.

### Switch between themes

Change `currentTheme` to the theme `id`. You can choose between `qb-core` and `default`.

### Creating custom themes

- Copy an existing theme based on which you want to create a new one
- Change the `id` to something unique
- Change the parameters of the theme accordingly

### Theme parameters

You can customize every theme using the parameters defined in `theme.json`. Following table explains a little bit about what each parameter can do

| Parameter                  | Description                                                   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| id                         | Unique ID for the theme                                       |
| borderRadius               | How round do you want the corners of the elements to be       |
| fontColor                  | Main color of the text                                        |
| fontColorHover             | Color of the text on hover                                    |
| fontColorSelected          | Color of the text when it is selected                         |
| fontFamily                 | Font of the text                                              |
| primaryBackground          | Main background color for the elements                        |
| primaryBackgroundSelected  | Main background color for the elements when they are selected |
| secondaryBackground        | Secondary background color                                    |
| scaleOnHover               | Increase the size of the elements on hover                    |
| sectionFontWeight          | Font weight for the section headings text                     |
| smoothBackgroundTransition | Enable to fade in to the background color during hover        |

*Note:* After creating the custom theme, make sure to change `currentTheme` to the `id` of the new theme. You can ofcourse modify the existing themes as well if you want, but it is recommended to create your own so that you can switch between the defaults and the custom one whenever needed.
